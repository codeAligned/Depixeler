To compile this program, simple type "make".
Note that this program requires OpenGL, and the Makefile is 
set up to compile for Mac OSX.  If you are not using OSX, you
will most likely need to update the LDFLAGS line in the makefile.
(There is a commented out line in the makefile that should work 
for Linux).

This will create an executable called "simplicialFluids".

PROGRAM: simplicialFluids

PURPOSE: Implementation of the Stable, Ciruclation-Preserving, Simplicial Fluids
algorithm described in http://www.geometry.caltech.edu/pubs/ETKSD07.pdf
The point of the algorithm is to use Discrete Differential Geometry to exactly
preserve circulation (and thus vorticity by Kelvin's Theorem) through each time
step of the fluid, and thus make it more visually realisitic. 

Usage: ./simplicialFluids [xRes] [yRes] [Run]

For example, run as follows:
./simplicialFluids 600 600 smw2_yoshi_01_input.png
